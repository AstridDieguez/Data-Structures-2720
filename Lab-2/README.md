## CSC 2720 Lab #2
Write a function called **backspaceCompare** that takes two strings *s1* and *s2* and evaluates them when both are typed into empty text editors. (# means a backspace character). **backspaceCompare** should return true if the evaluated strings are equal, or false if they are not equal. You should make use of the built-in Java implementation of the stack data structure under **java.util.Stack**. (Assume that the user inputs correct strings.)
