## CSC 2720 Lab #5
Given an array of unique positive integers, write a function findSums that takes the array input and:
1.	Creates a hashtable called “hashT” and inserts all the elements of the input array in the hashtable.
2.	Finds pairs of elements in the hashtable whose sum is another element (sum) in the hashtable and print the pairs in the console.
3.	Returns another hashtable names “sums” of those sum elements.
