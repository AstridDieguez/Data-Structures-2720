## Data Structures: Lab #7 Part 2
Given a string input **str** and a list of words to be ignored **toIgnore**, write a function *getMostCommonWord* that takes **str** and **toIgnore** as arguments and returns the most frequent word that is not in the **toIgnore** list. (Hint: Use a hashmap<String, Integer> for recording the frequency of all the words.)
