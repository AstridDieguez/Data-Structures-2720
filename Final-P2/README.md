## Data Structures: Final Part 2
Write a Java program to build an integer HashSet from scratch without using any built-in hash  libraries. Your program should include these functions:
a. insert (value): Insert any integer of your choice into the HashSet.  
b. contains(value) : Check the HashSet for the “value”. Return “True” if the particular integer exists in the HashSet else return “Hey Nothing there”.
c. remove(value): To remove an integer contained in the HashSet. If the integer to be removed does not exist in the HashSet, return “Hey value does not exist at all”, else remove the integer from the HashSet and return “Removed”.
