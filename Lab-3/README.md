## Data Structures: Lab #3
Write a function *deleteAtIndex* that takes a linked list **head** and an integer **index** as an argument, looks for the node in the linked list at index **index**, and deletes the node from the linked list (disconnects it from the list).

## Data Structures: Lab #3 Part 2
Given a pointer to the head node of a linked list, the task is to reverse the linked list. You need to reverse the list by changing links between nodes.
