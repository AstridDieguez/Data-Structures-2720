## Data Structures: Lab #6
Given an array consisting of 0's, 1's and 2's, write a function that sorts the given array without using any sorting methods from the Java Library. You need to write the sort function yourself from scratch.

The functions should put all 0's first, then all 1's and all 2's in last.
