## Data Structures: Lab #4
1. Import the Java project BinaryTrees to your IDE and create a new class called TreeTraversal.java.
2. Create the binary tree **tree2** (tree1 already exists in the code  template provided).
3. Write a function called *checkSkipped* that takes a tree as an argument traverses it in an **Inorder** traversal and prints out the traversed nodes. The function should return true if there is a skipped alpha character in the sequence, and false if the tree contains a perfect sequence of alphabets.
