## Data Structures: Assignment #1
You are to write a program name matrix.java that makes the dot products of 2 arrays.

1. Your program should prompt the user for the dimensions of the two squares matrices, making sure that the user input is equal to 50.
2.	If the above is not met, prompt the user for a new value.
3.	Now generate random integer numbers (ranging from 0 to 50) to fill both matrices.
4.	Display these two matrices on the screen.
5.	Multiply the two matrices and display the result on the screen.
6.	Insert a clock to see how long it would take to multiply these two matrices and display the time (with a message to this effect).
7.	Prompt the user asking if they want to repeat the program.
