## CSC 2720 Lab #2 Part 2
A palindrome is a string of characters that reads the same from left to right as it does from right to left. Write a function called **checkPalindrome** that takes a string *s1* and evaluate if the string is a palindrome or not using only a stack and a queue data structures. You should make use of the built-in Java implementation of the stack and queue data structure under **java.util.Stack** and **java.util.Queue**.
