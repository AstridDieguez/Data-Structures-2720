## CSC 2720 Lab #1 Part 2
Write a function called **isBalanced** that takes a string of braces as input and returns true if the braces in the string are balanced. If there are more ‘{’ than ‘}’ or more ‘}’ than ‘{’ in the string, the function should return false. You should make use of the built-in Java implementation of the stack data structure under **java.util.Stack**.
